        <p> A nice shot of the New York skyline. NYC  and the New York Sanctum will be a key setting in the film as it is shown at other parts of the trailer. </p>
        <img src= "https://i.imgur.com/QRpL7Xsr.png">
        <p> This is probably during the time when Thanos's ship is descending on Earth. It could be around the same time that Peter Parker sees the ship from his bus.</p>
        <img src= "https://i.imgur.com/vkLSnyh.gif">
        <p>Thanos has assembled two Infinity Stones so far: the Space Stone (blue) and the Power Stone (purple). 
                   The Space stone is the Tesserect from "The Avengers". The Power Stone is from "Guardians of the Galaxy." </p>
        <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BiodegradableMilkyIndianglassfish-max-1mb.gif">
        <p> This scene is somewhat misleading. Gamora and Tony aren't talking to each other. Gamora is in the Milano and Tony is most likely in the New York Sanctum, talking to Doctor Strange. </p>
        <img src= "http://screencrush.com/files/2018/03/infinitywargif2.gif?w=800&h=297&q=75">
        <p> Peter sees the ship outside and suits up. Thanos's arrival is relatively early on in the movie, since Peter is still wearing his "Homecoming" suit.</p>
        <img src= "http://screencrush.com/files/2018/03/infinitywargif12.gif?w=800&h=333&q=75">
        <p> Tony Stark is always updating his suits. His two jet boots combine into a more powerful one. He appears to be chasing one of Thanos's ships that have recently landed. </p>
        <img src= "https://asthebunnyhops.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Eye-of-Agamotto.gif">
        <p> The Eye of Agamotto is yet another Infinity Stone: the Time Stone. Thanos will most likely aquire it in this movie or in Infinity War Pt.II</p>
        <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UnimportantDapperGossamerwingedbutterfly-max-1mb.gif">
        <p> Vision and Wanda both have a dreadful look on their face. Looking at the background, this scene is in Wakanda. They are probaby scared since they know that Thanos is there for Vision's Mind Gem. The Mind Gem was also in "The Avengers": it was a part of Loki's sceptor, which allowed him mind-control several people.  </p>
        <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BigFrailFlamingo-max-1mb.gif">
        <p> If you pay attention to the background, a bunch of the Avnegers are there, including some from Tony's team in Civil War. Steve and Tony probably ended their beef or put it aside to focus on this new threat. Also, Rogers isn't Captain America anymore. In Civil War, when he threw down his shield (after fighting Tony), he also renounced his identity as Captain America. Now, he has taken on the persona of Nomad. </p>
        <img src= "https://asthebunnyhops.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Shuri.gif">
        <p> The main reason that the Avengers are in Wakanda may be because of Shuri. Due to her being a technological genius, she may be the only one who can successfully remove the Mind Stone from Vsion without harming him.</p>
        <img src= https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MeatyAbsoluteBuzzard-max-1mb.gif>
        <p> Tony and Peter Quill don't seem to get along, mostly since they're both the leaders of their respective teams and have similar personalities. Peter Parker is just standing there like, "Are they seriously doing this?" This is probably towards the climax scene since Peter has his "Iron Spider" suit and they seem to be in an alien planet.</p>
        <img src= "https://media1.tenor.com/images/6c7afdb8c2e2ad6dfc8f6103a4063ad2/tenor.gif?itemid=11382460">
        <p> We get a look at the Hulkbster 2.0, which looks pretty badass. </p>
        <img src= "https://thumbs.gfycat.com/SpotlessCostlyGiantschnauzer-max-1mb.gif">
        <p> Thor is powering up. This is probably where he created his new weapon, Jarnbjorn, the axe from Ultimate Marvel. This scene may be early on in the movie, after the Guardians find Thor.</p>
        <img src= "https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DisfiguredMixedAtlanticsharpnosepuffer-max-1mb.gif">
        <p> This is a flashback of when Thanos conquered Gamora's homeworld and destroyed her species. Remember that Gamora and Nebula are the adopted daughters of Thanos. He raised them to be assassins.</p>
        <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EcstaticThirdIsabellinewheatear-max-1mb.gif">
        <p> Thor is clearly outmatched against Thanos. This could be during the climax scene, since Thanos has on his full armor.</p>
        <img src= "https://thumbs.gfycat.com/VioletPassionateHellbender-max-1mb.gif">
        <p> We see Loki with Thanos's Black Order, consisting of Corvus Glaive, Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight, and Cull Obsidian. Loki has been presumably captured by them since Proxima Midnight is pointing her staff at his head. He was forced to give the Tesseract over to Thanos, who crushes it to put into his gaunlet.</p>
        <img src= "http://screencrush.com/files/2018/03/infinitywargif7.gif?w=800&h=333&q=75">
        <p> The Avngers and the Wakandan army get ready to face off against Thanos and his army.</p>
        <img src= "https://i.redd.it/hsf8oh3hnkm01.gif">
        <p>Doctor Strange makes steps for Star Lord as he fights across the battlefield. This is during the climax scene.</p>
        <img src="https://fsmedia.imgix.net/e5/8f/da/95/7fea/4025/869e/6f87a804bdba/ebony-mawgif.gif?auto=format%2Ccompress&w=700&gifq=35">
        <p> Ebony Maw tortures Strange either for information about the whereabouts of the other stones or his own stone. Maw is similar to Strange in that he has dark magic powers.</p>
        <img src= "https://media.giphy.com/media/iOG0ztXBk7Vx9TeXzX/giphy.gif">
        <p>The hulkbuster gets overwhelmed by the Outriders. A lot of people are saying that it's actually Hulk inside the Hulkbuster and not Tony.</p>
        <img src="http://www.bollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/avengers.gif" style="width:400px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">
        <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DefiniteShabbyBunny-max-1mb.gif" style="width:400px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;">
        <p> Thanos says "I hope they remember you" most likely to Tony and then goes for what seems like a final blow. Tony's armor is broken and he seems weakened and defeated. At least one person will die in this movie. The top candidates are either Rogers or Stark, even though people will be devastated at either one of their deaths. Unlike most other parts of the trailer, these three shots appear to be from  the same scene, judging from the backgraound and color tone. But trailers are usually misleading and it could be possible that both of them survive.</p>
        <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/IgnorantImpishBarracuda-max-1mb.gif">
        <p>This is, by far, one of the most badass scenes in the entire trailer. Rogers is able to hold his own against Thanos, which surpises both him and the audience. Marvel likes to showcase Rogers's strength: in a similar scene in Civil War, Cap held on to a helicopter with his bare hands.</p>
        <img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/LividIllfatedAsianlion-max-1mb.gif">
        <p> Peter finally meets Doctor Strange. Despite the seriousness of the movie, Infinity War is going to be humurous just like the other MCU films. </p>

        <p> The best scenes in any Spiderman film are when he's swinging through the air.</p>
